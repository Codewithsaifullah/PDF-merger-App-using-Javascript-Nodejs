🚀 Excited to share my latest project - PDFX, a web application that simplifies PDF merging!

📎 In response to the need for a user-friendly tool to merge PDF files seamlessly, I developed PDFX using JavaScript, Express.js, and PDF-merger-js.

📂 PDFX allows users to merge multiple PDF files effortlessly. Whether it's combining resumes, reports, or presentations, PDFX streamlines the process with just a few clicks.

🔧 Here's how it works:

Users upload PDF files through a simple and intuitive interface.
The backend, powered by Express.js, processes the files and merges them into a single PDF document using PDF-merger-js.
Users can then download the merged PDF file instantly.
👨‍💻 As a developer, I prioritized simplicity and functionality in PDFX. The clean interface ensures a smooth user experience, while the backend processes the files securely and efficiently.

🎉 I'm thrilled to share PDFX with you and invite you to try it out: [Link to your PDFX application]

🌟 Special thanks to the amazing open-source community for developing tools like Express.js, Multer, and PDF-merger-js, which made PDFX possible.
